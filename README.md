# **Power** System **S**tocastic **D**ual **D**ynamic **P**rogramming

The main goal of this library is to provide support for studies regarding the optimal dispatch of power systems, majorly comprised of Thermoelectric and Hydroelectric Generators.

> **Note 1** This is an under development library.

A special thank should be given to professor **André Marcato**. This project does not intend to substitute the similar library `PySDDP`.

> **Note 1** This project is being developed alongside the masters course: _Planejamento de Sistemas Elétricos_, as part of the masters program in Energy Systems at the [_Electrical Engineering Graduate Program_](https://www2.ufjf.br/ppee-en/) from the  _Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora - Brazil_

> **Note 2** The code will evolve alongside the video lectures provided by professor Marcato at: [Curso de Planejamento de Sistemas Elétricos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4D_mouXoUw&list=PLz7tpQ4EY_ne0gfWIqw6pJFrCglT6fjq7)
